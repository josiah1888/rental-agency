## JBurchard Rentals

[JBurchard Rentals](https://glaring-torch-2375.firebaseapp.com/) is a demo rental agency website using Angular2 + TypeScript + Firebase.
You can see property listings and share them to Facebook from the site.

#[Live Demo](https://glaring-torch-2375.firebaseapp.com/)

If you log in with `test@jburchard.com` and `Password123` you can edit the properties and watch them live reload to all other clients.

I write a tiny [Firebase Service](https://github.com/josiah1888/rental-agency/blob/master/src/app/services/firebase.service.ts) to integrate my live database with Angular2. 
It's not battle-tested by any means, but it might help you get going on your own Firebase service.
Leave an issue if you have any feedback for me.
